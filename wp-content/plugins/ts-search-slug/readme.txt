Search for Slug in Admin Post/Page Overview and add Slug Column to Post/Page Overview.

== Description ==
With this plugin you can search posts for their slug and their post id, see the slug and post id in admin post overview in an additional column and sort by them.

For searching multiple Post IDs in the search field, you can separate them with ",", in example "36723,298525,3732".

And you can see an overview of all pages which are tagged with post states, and quick switch to them.
For that, you must switch to the page overview and klick the button to open the list.

Please keep in mind, this is a hobby project and I need some time to respond.
I'm always open to suggestions for improvement.

Please contact me over the support forum on the plugin page on issues. 

== Installation ==
